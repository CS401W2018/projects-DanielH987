      <h2>Smart Study Tips for CS Students</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a freshman or nearing graduation, having solid study
        strategies can make a huge difference. Here are some field-tested tips
        to help you succeed in computer science.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Use the Pomodoro Technique</h3>
      <p>
        Study in focused 25-minute sessions with 5-minute breaks in between.
        This keeps your brain fresh and helps avoid burnout. <br>

      <h3>2. Break Big Problems Into Small Ones</h3>
      <p>
        Donâ€™t try to solve an entire coding assignment at once. Break it into
        functions or features, and tackle each one step-by-step.

      <h3>3. Form or Join a Study Group</h3>
      <p>
        Explaining concepts to others is a powerful way to reinforce your
        understanding.

      <h3>4. Watch and Rewatch Video Tutorials</h3>
      <p>
        When stuck, find a reliable YouTube tutorial. Just donâ€™t rely on it
        aloneâ€”follow up with practice.
        <br>
        Example:

      </p>

      <h3>5. Learn How to Learn</h3>
      <p>
        Take time to understand how you study bestâ€”visual, auditory,
        kinesthetic? Adjust your environment to fit your learning style.
