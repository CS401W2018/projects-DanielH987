            <strong>Question 1: Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</strong>
            <br>
            Visit this <a href="https://speeches.byuh.edu/devotional-executive-committee-of-byu-hawaiis-board-of-trustees-2025-01-28" target="_blank">Website</a> for more information about the devotional tomorrow.

        <p>
            <strong>Question 2: Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</strong>
            <br>
            An absolute link contains the full URL, including the protocol (e.g., https://), and points to a specific location on the web. A relative link points to somewhere in this website. Relative links are useful for linking to other pages within the same website because they are shorter and more flexible if the domain name changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 3: Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</strong>
            <br>
            Check out the <a href="structural.html">Structural Engagement</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 4: List the 3 rules with relative links.</strong>
            <br>
            1. Use a leading slash (/) to link from the root directory.<br>
            2. Use a double dot (..) to move up one directory level.<br>
            3. Use a single dot (.) to link within the same directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 5: Link to your last project.</strong>
            <br>
            View my last project <a href="../projects/interests.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 6: Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</strong>
            <br>
            No, links do not always need to be inside a NAV tag. They can be placed anywhere in the HTML document where a hyperlink is needed.
