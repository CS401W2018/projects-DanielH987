            <strong>Question 1: Why is the viewport meta tag important?</strong>
            <br>
            The viewport meta tag is important because it controls the layout on mobile browsers. Without it, mobile devices will render the page at a desktop width, making it difficult to read and interact with. It ensures that the page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 2: How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</strong>
            <br>
            We can adjust the CSS for printing by using a separate stylesheet with media queries for print, or by adding print-specific styles within the main stylesheet using the <code>@media print</code> rule. This allows us to hide unnecessary elements, change font sizes, and adjust layouts for better print formatting.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 3: When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</strong>
            <br>
            We would want to adjust the CSS for printing when we expect users to print the web page. This is common for pages with articles, reports, invoices, or any content that users might need a hard copy of. Proper print styles ensure that the printed version is clean, readable, and well-formatted.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 4: Why do we need a viewport meta tag?</strong>
            <br>
            The viewport meta tag controls the layout on mobile browsers. Without it, mobile devices will render the page at a desktop width, making it difficult to read and interact with. It it to make sure that the page is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 5: When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority?</strong>
            <br>
            The rule that takes priority is the one that appears last in the CSS file. CSS follows the "last rule wins" principle, so the last declaration of "flex-direction" will be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 6: How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone?</strong>
            <br>
            To change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone, we can use media queries targeting smaller screen sizes. For example, we can use the <code>@media</code> rule with a max-width condition to apply specific styles for devices with a width of 600px or less.
