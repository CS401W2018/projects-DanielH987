          >Question 1: The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it
          do?</strong
        >
        <br />
        The "action" attribute in a form tag specifies the URL to which the form
        data will be sent when the form is submitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Question 2: The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it
          do?</strong
        >
        <br />
        The "method" attribute in a form tag defines the HTTP method used to
        send form data to the server. The common values are "GET" and "POST".
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Question 3: What is the difference between a "POST" and a
          "GET"?</strong
        >
        <br />
        "GET" sends form data as URL parameters and is typically used for
        retrieving data, while "POST" sends data in the request body, making it
        more secure for sensitive information and commonly used for creating or
        updating resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question 4: What are different ways to style your form?</strong>
        <br />
        There are several ways to style your form, including using CSS for
        layout and design, applying frameworks like Bootstrap for responsive
        design, and using custom JavaScript for dynamic styling and validation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question 5: Why does the professor like to use flex?</strong>
        <br />
        Brother Slade likes to use flex because the CSS Flexbox layout model
        provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space
        among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Question 6: What is JavaScript? How did it get its name?</strong
        >
        <br />
        JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for
        creating interactive and dynamic content on websites. It was originally
        named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript to
        capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Question 7: What are the two ways you can run JavaScript?</strong
        >
        <br />
        JavaScript can be run in a web browser, where it is executed by the
        browser's JavaScript engine, or on a server using environments like
        Node.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Question 8: What was the most popular front-end js library?</strong
        >
        <br />
        jQuery was the most popular front-end JavaScript library for many years
        due to its simplicity and cross-browser compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Question 9: What is the most popular front-end js library
          today?</strong
        >
        <br />
        React is currently the most popular front-end JavaScript library, widely
        used for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question 10: What is AJAX?</strong>
        <br />
        AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for creating fast
        and dynamic web pages by allowing data to be exchanged with a server
        and updating parts of a web page without reloading the entire page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question 11: Why do you put your JS Code in a separate file?</strong>
        <br />
        Placing JavaScript code in a separate file improves code organization,
        reusability, and maintainability. It also helps in keeping the HTML
        clean and allows browsers to cache the JavaScript file for better
        performance.
