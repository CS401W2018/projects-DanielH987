        <h2>Form</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 1: The form tag has an "action" attribute. What does it do?</strong>
            <br>
            The "action" attribute in a form tag specifies the URL to which the form data will be sent when the form is submitted.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 2: The form tag has a "method" attribute. What does it do?</strong>
            <br>
            The "method" attribute in a form tag defines the HTTP method used to send form data to the server. The common values are "GET" and "POST".
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 3: What is the difference between a "POST" and a "GET"?</strong>
            <br>
            "GET" sends form data as URL parameters and is typically used for retrieving data, while "POST" sends data in the request body, making it more secure for sensitive information and commonly used for creating or updating resources.
