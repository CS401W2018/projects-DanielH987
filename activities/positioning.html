        <h2>Positioning</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 1: What is normal flow in HTML?</strong>
            <br>
            Normal flow is the way that elements are displayed on a web page when no special positioning has been applied. Elements are stacked one after the other, block-level elements from top to bottom and inline elements from left to right.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 2: What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</strong>
            <br>
            The float property in CSS is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it. Clearing the float is necessary to ensure that elements below the floated element are properly positioned and do not wrap around it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 3: What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</strong>
            <br>
            Absolute positioning removes an element from the normal flow and positions it relative to its closest positioned ancestor. Fixed positioning removes an element from the normal flow and positions it relative to the viewport, so it stays in place when the page is scrolled. Relative positioning moves an element relative to its normal position without removing it from the normal flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 4: How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</strong>
            <br>
            To make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices, we can use CSS to style the buttons with larger touch targets, clear and readable text, and appropriate spacing. We can also use media queries to adjust the styles for different screen sizes and make sure the navigation is responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 5: Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</strong>
            <br>
            We can find videos to review what we talked about in the class Canvas module "".
