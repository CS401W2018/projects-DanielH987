            <strong>Question 1: What is the difference between block tags and inline tags?</strong>
            <br>
            Block tags take up the full width available and start on a new line, while inline tags take up only as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 2: What is the margin, border, and padding?</strong>
            <br>
            Margin is the space outside the border of an element, border is the line surrounding the padding and content, and padding is the space between the content and the border.
        </p>

            <strong>Question 3: What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</strong>
            <br>
            Units of measurement in CSS include pixels (px), ems (em), rems (rem), percentages (%), viewport width (vw), viewport height (vh), and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Question 4: When would you use a figure tag?</strong>
            <br>
            The figure tag is used to group media content (like images, illustrations, diagrams, etc.) along with their captions, making it easier to associate them together.
