    <h1>Daniel Hootini's Profile</h1>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is Daniel Hootini, and I am passionate about web development. I enjoy exploring new technologies and improving my coding skills every day.

        In my free time, I love playing sports, especially basketball or volleyball. When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym for some free play.
