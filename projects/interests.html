        <h2>Rubik's Cubes</h2>
        <p>Rubik's Cubes are fascinating puzzles that challenge my problem-solving skills and patience. Solving them provides a sense of accomplishment and helps improve my cognitive abilities.</p>
        <p>Another reason I enjoy Rubik's Cubes is the endless variety of patterns and techniques to learn. Itâ€™s a rewarding hobby that keeps me engaged and allows me to compete with others or simply relax while solving.</p>
        <p>Relative links are links used to navigate between pages within the same website. For example, this <a href="profile.html">Profile Page</a> link is a relative link to the first assignment. On the other hand, absolute links are links that take the user to external websites. For example, this link: <a href="https://www.rubiks.com/" target="_blank">Rubik's Official Website</a> will help you learn more about Rubik's Cubes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="emphasized">What color did you choose to emphasize text? <br> I chose #ff6600 for emphasized text.</span></li>
            <li><span class="deemphasized">What color did you choose to de-emphasize text? <br> I chose #777 for de-emphasized text.</span></li>
            <li>How did you choose your colors? Did you use a tool online to help you find colors? <br> Yes, I used an online <a href="https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/" target="_blank">color picker tool</a> to find colors that complement each other and ensure good readability.</li>
