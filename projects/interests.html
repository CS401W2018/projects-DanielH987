        <p>Rubik's Cubes are fascinating puzzles that challenge my problem-solving skills and patience. Solving them provides a sense of accomplishment and helps improve my cognitive abilities.</p>
        <p>Another reason I enjoy Rubik's Cubes is the endless variety of patterns and techniques to learn. Itâ€™s a rewarding hobby that keeps me engaged and allows me to compete with others or simply relax while solving.</p>
        <p>Relative links are links used to navigate between pages within the same website. For example, this <a href="profile.html">Profile Page</a> link is a relative link to the first assignment. On the other hand, absolute links are links that take the user to external websites. For example, this link: <a href="https://www.rubiks.com/" target="_blank">Rubik's Official Website</a> will help you learn more about Rubik's Cubes.</p>
